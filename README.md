# TeRSA multitool
This is a tool for using RSA encryption. It can generate keys, decode RSA encoded messages (given the correct private key), and encode messages with a given public key. It depends on simpletkinter for the gui and Pycryptodome for the large prime number generation.


## Screenshots
This is the GUI as of commit 1.05.
